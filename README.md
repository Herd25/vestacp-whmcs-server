# Introduction

The WHMCS plugin allows to manage servers running Vesta Control Panel. You can automatically create delete or suspend user accounts. Users are able to change passwords and manage their web/mail/dns domains.

# Installation

I recommend using git and setting a cron to pull from the repo here. WHMCS does not support a structured package system like composer so this is one method to automate the process.
